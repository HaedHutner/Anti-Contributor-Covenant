# Anti-Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community as easy and harassment-free of an experience as they can provide for themselves. Regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation, you will be treated the same as everyone else.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a constructive environment include:

* Using productive and to-the-point language
* Never forgetting to point out evident flaws in eachother's viewpoints
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the project
* Showing vigorous dedication towards your contributions

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, unproductive or unconstructive.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of unproductive or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at <e-mail>. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce this Code of Conduct may receive a slap on the wrist or other irrelevant repercussion as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
